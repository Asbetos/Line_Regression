# Line_Regression
## Implementation of line regression technique in C language.
This is a model for predicting the stock values.
The model uses a simple line regression algorithm.
The equation of the line is calculated in the form of y=mx+c.
Here x is the independant variable and y, the dependant one. m is the slope and c is the offset.
Once the values of m and c are found based on the inputted x and y values, the line is extrapolated to predict the stock 
value for the coming days.
